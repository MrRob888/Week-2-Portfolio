So close yet so far!

This Was my first time building a Website from Scratch and i ended up going down some worng rabbit holes trying to learn different things i spent way too much time trying to make the project cards perfect which ate alot of my time, overall i'm happy with the neon buttons, but definately should of had a broader focus and just aimed to meet criterier rather than trying to get it to an end stage product

If I had more time i would have done more to clean up the site, such as the submit button being a bit odd and I probablly would have done more refactoring of the code.
